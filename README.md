# example stack for modern web development
This is the example app for the talk Bernd and Ansgar gave on the Hamburg Education and Technology Meetup on 2018/01/21.

It is not documented well as we don't know whether anyone is going to go through the code at all. So if you have questions please [file an issue](https://github.com/elbstack/example-stack-cra-graphql-netlify/issues/new) and we'll be happy to help :)

## steps how this was set up

1.
```
npx create-react-app
```
2. created `functions/` directory


## netlify
